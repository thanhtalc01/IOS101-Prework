Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement.
My whole family uses Facebook every day whenever they have free time. Facebook makes it easier for people to stay connected with friends, relatives, and communities by sharing posts, photos, videos, or status updates. It already has some useful features; however, I would like to add a few more that I believe will help people feel even more connected. A mood-based post feature would be great because you could share how youâ€™re feeling and connect with others who feel the same way. Adding mini quizzes, games, or challenges in the feed could also help bring people with similar interests together. Lastly, a built-in calendar would make it easier and quicker to plan events and appointments.
